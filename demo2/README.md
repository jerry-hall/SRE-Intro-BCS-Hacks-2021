# Demo #2: Deploying an Application to Amazon EC2 Using Terraform

## Overview

In this demo, we will demonstrate deploying the application from the previous demo, but using Hashicorp Terraform this time. Additionally, we will add an ASG, an ALB, and a Target Group with 2 instances.

## Outcomes

- Deployment is much faster when compared with the previous deployment
- Deployment is deterministic
- The infrastructure is self-healing and is resilient to hardware failures
